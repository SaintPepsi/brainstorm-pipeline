# Test Implementer Agent Instructions

## Purpose
Write actual test files from test plans. Tests MUST FAIL initially because the feature doesn't exist yet.

## Input
- Design document: `docs/designs/*.md`
- Unit test plan: `docs/test-plans/unit-test-plan.md`
- E2E test plan: `docs/test-plans/e2e-test-plan.md`

## Process
1. **Read Both Test Plans** completely. Understand every test case, assertion, and setup requirement.

2. **Implement Unit Tests First**:
   - Create test file(s) at locations specified in unit-test-plan.md
   - Follow project's test framework (from `.design-to-deploy.yml`)
   - Use consistent setup/teardown patterns
   - Import mocking utilities as needed
   - Write assertions that are specific and fail meaningfully

3. **Implement E2E Tests**:
   - Create test file(s) in `tests/e2e/` directory
   - Use Playwright framework
   - Follow page object model or similar pattern
   - Include screenshot capture logic
   - Add comments explaining each action/assertion pair

4. **Verify Tests FAIL**:
   - Run unit test suite: follow command in `.design-to-deploy.yml`
   - Run E2E test suite: follow command in `.design-to-deploy.yml`
   - **CONFIRM**: All new tests fail with clear "not implemented" or similar errors
   - Document which tests are failing and why

## Output

### Test Files
Create at paths specified in test plans:
```
tests/unit/{module}.test.ts
tests/e2e/{feature}.spec.ts
```

### Test Verification Report
Create file at:
```
docs/test-reports/test-implementation-report.md
```

## Required Report Format

```markdown
## Unit Test Implementation
- Test file(s) created: {list paths}
- Total unit tests written: {count}
- Framework: {jest | vitest | mocha | other}
- Test command: {exact command used}

## Unit Test Execution Results
- Status: ALL TESTS FAILING (expected)
- Failures summary:
  - {test name}: {failure reason - typically "feature not yet implemented"}
  - {test name}: {failure reason}
  - ...
- Passing tests: {count}
- Failing tests: {count}

## E2E Test Implementation
- Test file(s) created: {list paths}
- Total E2E tests written: {count}
- Framework: Playwright
- Test command: {exact command used}

## E2E Test Execution Results
- Status: ALL TESTS FAILING (expected)
- Sample failures:
  - {test name}: {failure reason - typically "page not found" or "button not found"}
  - {test name}: {failure reason}
- Passing tests: {count}
- Failing tests: {count}

## Test Quality Checks
- [ ] All tests have clear, descriptive names
- [ ] All assertions are specific (not vague)
- [ ] Setup/teardown is properly structured
- [ ] Mocks are configured correctly
- [ ] E2E tests capture screenshots at key points
- [ ] No hardcoded timeouts (or documented if necessary)

## Next Steps
Feature implementation should make these tests pass.

## DRY Requirements — Import, Don't Copy

- **Create shared helpers first**: Before writing any test file, create shared test utilities (factories, fixtures, setup helpers) identified in the test plans. All test files import from these — no duplicated setup code.
- **Import production constants**: Import types, constants, enums, and validation rules from the implementation source. Never redefine values that already exist in production code.
- **Shared factories over inline data**: If multiple tests need similar test objects, create a factory function in a shared module. Tests call the factory, not copy-paste the object literal.
- **Common setup in beforeEach helpers**: If multiple `describe` blocks share setup logic, extract it into a shared helper and import it. Don't copy-paste `beforeEach` blocks.
- **Page objects for E2E**: If the test plans specify shared page objects, create them first and import them in every E2E test file. Never duplicate selectors or interaction sequences across test files.

## Guidelines
- Write tests that are easy to debug when they fail
- Use descriptive test names: "should return X when given Y"
- Avoid testing implementation details—test behavior
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- E2E tests should use real browser where possible
- Each test should be independent (don't rely on test order)
- Include comments explaining complex test setup
