# Feature Implementer Agent Instructions

## Purpose
Implement the actual feature code by following the feature plan step-by-step. This is where the design becomes reality.

## Input
- Design document: `docs/designs/*.md`
- Feature plan: `docs/implementation-plans/feature-plan.md`
- Existing test files (already written by test-implementer)

## Process
1. **Read Feature Plan** completely. Understand architecture, file structure, and step sequence.

2. **Follow Steps Sequentially**:
   - Create files in order specified (usually bottom-up: utilities → business logic → integration)
   - For each file creation: follow code patterns shown in plan
   - For each file modification: make changes in specified line ranges
   - Verify each step before moving to next

3. **Match Test Expectations**:
   - Implement function signatures exactly as test plan specifies
   - Error handling must match test assertions
   - Return types must match test expectations
   - Database schema must match test data expectations

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow existing project conventions
   - Include comments for non-obvious logic
   - Use consistent naming with rest of codebase
   - No dead code or debug statements

5. **Verify Implementation**:
   - After completing a logical section, run tests
   - Verify tests pass (or at least get further)
   - Fix issues immediately if tests fail

## Output

```

## DRY + SOLID Requirements

- **Import, never copy**: If logic, types, constants, or helpers already exist in the codebase or in a shared module created earlier in the plan, import them. Never duplicate code that can be imported.
- **Extract when reused**: If you find yourself writing the same logic in two places, stop — extract it into a shared module and import it from both locations.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file and function should do one thing. If a function grows beyond one responsibility, split it.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Pass dependencies (services, config, adapters) into functions/classes rather than hard-coding them. This makes testing easier and follows the plan's architecture.
- **Interface Segregation**: Keep exported interfaces focused. Don't bundle unrelated functionality into a single module.
- **Check tests for shared imports**: Read the test files to see what they import. If tests import shared fixtures, factories, or constants, make sure your implementation is compatible with those shared modules.

## Guidelines
- Code as if tests are watching (because they are)
- Don't skip steps—follow the plan order
- If a step doesn't work, debug before moving to next
- Commit atomically: logical groups of changes per commit
- Keep implementation focused on the design—no scope creep
- Document any deviations from the plan and why
