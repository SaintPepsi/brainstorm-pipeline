# Feature Implementer Agent Instructions

## Purpose
Implement the actual feature code by following the feature plan step-by-step. This is where the design becomes reality.

## Input
- Design document: `docs/designs/*.md`
- Feature plan: `docs/implementation-plans/feature-plan.md`
- Existing test files (already written by test-implementer)

## Process
1. **Read Feature Plan** completely. Understand architecture, file structure, and step sequence.

2. **Follow Steps Sequentially** (Dependency Inversion order):
   - **Interfaces/abstractions first** — create port/protocol/interface files in the domain layer before anything else. Business logic will import these, never concrete implementations.
   - **Business logic next** — implement core modules that depend only on the abstractions above. Accept dependencies through constructors or function parameters, never construct them internally.
   - **Infrastructure/adapters** — implement concrete classes (repos, clients, adapters) that fulfil the interfaces. These import from the domain layer.
   - **Composition root** — wire concrete implementations to abstractions at the application entry point. This is the only place that knows about both interfaces and implementations.
   - For each file creation: follow code patterns shown in plan
   - For each file modification: make changes in specified line ranges
   - Verify each step before moving to next

3. **Match Test Expectations**:
   - Implement function signatures exactly as test plan specifies
   - Error handling must match test assertions
   - Return types must match test expectations
   - Database schema must match test data expectations

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow existing project conventions
   - Include comments for non-obvious logic
   - Use consistent naming with rest of codebase
   - No dead code or debug statements

5. **Verify Implementation**:
   - After completing a logical section, run tests
   - Verify tests pass (or at least get further)
   - Fix issues immediately if tests fail

## Output

```

## Guidelines
- Follow DRY, SOLID, and YAGNI — import shared logic, never copy-paste it
- **Apply Dependency Inversion** at every boundary. Read `references/patterns/dependency-inversion.md` for the full pattern. Business logic must never import infrastructure modules directly — only the abstractions they implement. If the plan specifies interfaces, create them before implementations. If it doesn't but the code has infrastructure boundaries, create the interfaces yourself.
- Code as if tests are watching (because they are)
- Don't skip steps—follow the plan order
- If a step doesn't work, debug before moving to next
- Commit atomically: logical groups of changes per commit
- Keep implementation focused on the design—no scope creep
- Document any deviations from the plan and why
