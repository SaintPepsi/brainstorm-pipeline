# Feature Planner Agent Instructions

## Purpose
Create detailed implementation roadmap with file structure, code changes, and step-by-step implementation guidance.

## Input
- Design document from `docs/designs/`
- Project repository structure
- Existing code patterns and conventions

## Process
1. **Understand Architecture**: Review design doc's technical approach and map to actual codebase.

2. **Plan File Structure**: For each new component/module:
   - Decide file locations following project conventions
   - List all files to create with brief purpose
   - Identify all files to modify with line ranges and reason

3. **Sequence Implementation**: Order steps so:
   - Infrastructure/utilities are created first
   - Core business logic next
   - UI/integration last
   - Dependencies are satisfied before dependents

4. **Add Code Guidance**: For each step, include:
   - What needs to be written
   - Code snippets showing approach/patterns
   - Reference to similar code in project

## Output
Create feature plan at:
```
docs/implementation-plans/feature-plan.md
```

## Required Format

### Architecture Overview
Diagram or text description showing:
- New components and their relationships
- Integration points with existing code
- Data flow
- Key modules and dependencies

### Files to Create

```markdown
## New Files

### {file_path}
**Purpose**: {what this file does}
**Type**: (component | utility | config | service | hook | etc)
**Dependencies**: {what this imports}
**Approximate lines**: {LOC}
```

### Files to Modify

```markdown
## Modified Files

### {file_path}
**Reason**: {why we're modifying}
- **Lines {start}-{end}**: {description of change}
  - Current: {show current code}
  - New: {show new code / pattern}
```

### Implementation Steps

```markdown
## Step 1: {create/modify what}
**Files affected**: {file_list}
**Rationale**: {why this step first}

{Code snippet showing pattern or approach}

**Verification**: How to manually verify this step works

---
## Step 2: {create/modify what}
...
```

### Verification Plan
For each major step, specify:
- How to manually test this step
- What the expected behavior/output is
- How to verify it integrates with next steps

### Risk Areas
- Sections that are complex or error-prone
- Areas needing extra testing attention
- Breaking changes to existing code

## DRY + SOLID Requirements

Before sequencing implementation steps, identify reuse opportunities:

1. **Audit for existing code**: Search the codebase for utilities, helpers, types, or constants that already do what's needed. Plan to import them — never rewrite.
2. **Extract shared modules first**: If multiple files will need the same logic, types, or constants, plan a shared module as the first implementation step. Both feature code and tests should import from it.
3. **Follow SOLID**: Each planned module should have a single responsibility. Prefer composition over inheritance. Design interfaces that are focused and minimal.
4. **No copy-paste in the plan**: If a code snippet appears in more than one step, extract it into a shared module step and import it instead.

In the **Files to Create** section, explicitly call out any shared/utility modules with a `**Shared**: yes` tag so downstream agents know these are import targets.

## Guidelines
- Be concrete: show code, not abstractions
- Reference existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep steps small enough to implement and verify independently
- Provide enough detail that another Claude agent could follow it
- Include file paths relative to project root
- Specify line numbers for modifications in existing files
