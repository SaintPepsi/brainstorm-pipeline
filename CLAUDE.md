# Brainstorm Pipeline

## Task Tracking

Use `createTask` proactively to break down work into trackable items. Create tasks when:

- Starting any multi-step work (3+ steps)
- Running a pipeline stage (design-to-deploy, github-issue-to-deploy)
- Working through a design doc, issue, or PR review

Keep tasks updated as you go — mark in-progress when starting, complete when done, and add new tasks as you discover work.
